# Maintenance Page - Error Hub

Welcome to the **maintenance page** for Error Hub! This is a simple but stylish page I created to let users know when the site is under maintenance. It includes some cool features like a light snowflake animation and quick links to useful platforms like Discord and YouTube.

## Why I Made This

I originally built this page for my **personal use**. The idea was to have a clean, professional message for when the site needs a little downtime. But since I figured it might be useful to others, I decided to share it. If you find it helpful, feel free to use it or tweak it for your own projects!

## Cool Features

- **Customizable**: Easily change the links and text via a simple config file.
- **Snowflake Effect**: Adds a subtle touch of animation with snowflakes (using Font Awesome icons).
- **Modern Design**: Gradient background, button animations, and a clean layout make it look good on any device.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: The page is fully responsive, so it looks great on both desktops and smartphones.

## Use It However You Like!

Even though I built this for my own project, I’m more than happy for you to use and adapt it however you want. Make it yours!
